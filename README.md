# üìùProject Overview

This exploratory data analysis aims to investigate the human space flight program from NASA and analyze whether there were any gender biases in the selection of astronauts. 

The purpose of this analysis was to gain insights into the representation of women in the program and identify potential areas for improvement. By analyzing historical data, we hoped to uncover any patterns or trends that may have influenced the selection process. Ultimately, this analysis can contribute to a better understanding of the gender gap in the space industry and inform future efforts to promote diversity and inclusivity.

# üóùÔ∏èKey Questions

1. What is the representation of women in the NASA astronaut program over time?
2. How has the selection process for astronauts changed over time?
3. What are the demographics of NASA astronauts?
4. Are there any differences in the demographics of male and female astronauts?
5. How do female astronauts compare to male astronauts in terms of experience and training?
6. Is there any evidence of gender bias in the selection process?

# üí°Recommendations

- To improve diversity and inclusivity in the astronaut program, NASA could consider actively recruiting and selecting more women and individuals from underrepresented groups. This could include expanding outreach efforts to universities and communities with diverse populations, as well as providing targeted support and mentorship programs for aspiring astronauts.
- To address the potential physiological effects of microgravity on women, NASA could consider conducting further research on this topic and implementing targeted interventions to support the health and well-being of female astronauts during spaceflight. This could include developing exercise and nutrition programs specifically tailored to women's needs, as well as exploring the use of new technologies and treatments to mitigate the effects of microgravity on bone and muscle health.
